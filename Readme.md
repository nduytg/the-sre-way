The SRE Way
===========

WIP - All contributions are welcome :D 

The way to develop and maintain large-scale systems from scratch

At my work, I have encountered many issues/questions (which I think are quite common) for many large-scale systems

Some topics I will cover here are:

* Load Balancing
* Service Discovery
* Configuration Mangement Tools
* CMDB
* How to build your (internal) Cloud Service
* Physical server vs VM vs Container. Which one is better?
* Scaling my service, how I should scale it?
* Is Document as Code good?
* Why we should use Pipeline as much as we can?
* How we should manage the repos for our tools? Monolith or...?
* ... if you have any interesting topics/questions, can open a new issue, we can discuss it together :D

# Introduction

Due to the nature of SRE teams, the services we provide mostly are internal services and platforms. Some of them are just simple APIs for managing services. Some ...

In this guide, we won't talk much about low-level technical details. We will focus more on principles, processes and standards. Which I believe are the most important things for any engineer teams.

Really hope that this guide can help you. Regardless whatever team size or how mature your team is. I think you will encounter at least 3 common issues I list above.
